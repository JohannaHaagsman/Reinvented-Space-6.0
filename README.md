Section I: What's this project about?
Reinvented Space is my longlasting ongoing art project. It started with a photo of a giant industrial scrap heap under a clear blue sky in 2007. Of that photo I started making art objects, like a collage, animation of the collage, several (sculptural) photo works combining photography and ceramics, paper, collage, and sometimes even some magic (the floating cube!). At some point (2012) I thought I had finished, but somehow it keeps messing with my head, so I decided this year to continue this. 

Version 6.0 is exactly what you see here. Me trying to figure out how to configure a Raspberry Pi, in order to let it track my walks, make a textfile of it, so I can print it, and then redraw my walks, and perhaps do other things with that later on. 

Section II: What do I (think I) need for this project?
First of all learning Python (at Volksuniversiteit/OB amsterdam/Codeacademy).
Then learning about Raspberry Pi.
Meanwhile hunt for tutorials and so on about tracking devices.
Make a listing of options for that, as for what do I need: a GPS tracker, or just a compass, which can detect which way (N/W/S/E) I am heading/turning. And some step counter, so that after each turn, my steps will be detected, counted, and turned into the right distance. At each turn, the step counter should go back to zero. 
In this way there should be made a textfile, sort of like this:

[time] [turn] [steps] [distance]
20:08:34 NW 367 steps 220,2 m

Section III: Notes and so
100 steps is about 60 m (for my body length 165 cm), so 1 step is 60 cm.
